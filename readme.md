This is my homework for week four.
The index.html shows a javascript quiz.  It has a 30 second timer.
The quiz starts when the "Start Quiz" button is pressed and ends
either when the time expires or the 15 questions are completed.

After the quiz is completed, the user is prompted to enter their initials.
If they enter their initials, it will add their score to the high scores in local storate and take them to highScores.html.

highScores.html shows the high scores recorded in local storage.
The "go back" button takes the user back to index.html.
The "clear scores" button clears out all the scores in local storage.
